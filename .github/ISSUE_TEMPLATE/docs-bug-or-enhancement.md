- [ ] I am sure this issue is not simply a general python programming problem
      (if so, please google the answers).
- [ ] I have searched github issues and confirm this issue has not reported previously.
- [ ] I have confirmed the problem or enhancement is about the latest docs of dynamo rather than dynamo itself (if so, please use Bug report template).
